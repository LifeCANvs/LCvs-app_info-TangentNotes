# Tangent-Public
## Open Source-ish
This is a collection of code used by [Tangent](https://www.tangentnotes.com) that has been made open source. This is currently a very limited selection that will start to open up as Tangent's publishing aspirations become solidified.

Not all of Tangent and its related projects will be open source, but subsets that will empower the community will be made so.

## Reporting Issues
As this repository is the public face of Tangent on [GitHub](https://github.com/suchnsuch/tangent-public), its issue tracking will serve as the primary way to track issues for the application as well as any of the actual packages in this repository.

When reporting issues for Tangent itself, be sure to use the "Tangent App" label to differentiate the issue from others. https://github.com/suchnsuch/tangent-public/labels/Tangent%20App

When reporting issues, please include:
1. The version of the relevant app / package.
2. A concise description in the title of the problem.
	* e.g. "Clicking the New Note button does not create a new note"
3. A thorough description of the problem in the body of the issue.
	* The steps required to cause the problem.
		* For example:
			1. "Open a blank workspace"
			2. "Click the New Note button"
			3. "Notice that a new note is not created"
	* Include any additional details or context that can help illuminate the issue.
4. Logs can sometimes be very helpful in sussing out a problem.
	* In-window logs can be found from the developer console. You can open this with `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows and Linux. Attaching a screenshot or the contents of these logs can be useful.
	* Application logs can be found in the relevant log folder on your system. You can invoke the "Show Logs" command from the Command Palette in Tangent (`Cmd/Ctrl+P` to open the palette) to bring you directly to the logs.
