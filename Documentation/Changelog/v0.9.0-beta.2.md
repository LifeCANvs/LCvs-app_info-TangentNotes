+ Changed default [[Bold and Italics]] behavior so that underscores surrounded by text does not trigger formatting.
+ Added error & warning indicators for YAML parsing errors in [[Front Matter]].
+ Added the ability to wrap from the first to the last item (and vice-versa) in the command palette & autocomplete menus.
- Fixed an issue where unclosed front matter still inserted a horizontal line.
- Fixed a regression where new [[Wiki Links]] to virtual files would not show up green once the file was actually created.
- Fixed an issue where using `Ctrl+Shift+Click` on a wiki link to replace the current pane when clicking on a link in a file in a [[Feed Lens]] didn't correctly replace that pane with the linked file.
