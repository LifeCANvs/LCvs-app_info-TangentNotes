Tangent implements the `Alt+Up` and `Alt+Down` shortcuts from code editors to shift your currently selected line(s) up and down.

You can also shift entire sections of content across other sections. On Mac, the shortcut is "⌃⌥ ↑" and "⌃⌥ ↓". On Windows & Linux, the shortcut is `Ctrl+Shift+Up` and `Ctrl+Shift+Down`.

What constitutes a section depends on what you have selected. If you just have a line selected, you will just shift that line. If you have a list item with children selected, that list item and all of its children will shift. If you have a header selected, the header and all of the content below it will shift.
